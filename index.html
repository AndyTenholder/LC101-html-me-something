            <header>The Story of the Three Little Pigs</header>
            <!-- First pig -->
            <p class="story-text">There was once a family of pigs. The mother pig was very poor, 
                and so she sent her three little pigs out to seek their fortunes. 
                The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him:</p>
            <p class="pig-quote">&quotPlease, man, give me that straw to build me a house.&quot</p>               
            <p class="story-text">Which the man did, and the little pig built a house with it. 
                Presently came along a wolf, and knocked at the door, and said:</p>
            <p class="wolf-quote">&quotLittle pig, little pig, let me come in.&quot</p>
            <p class="pig-quote">&quotNo, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.&quot</p>
            <p class="wolf-quote">&quotThen I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.&quot</p>
            <p class="story-text">So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the little pig.</p>

            <!-- second pig -->
            <p class="story-text">The second little pig met a man with a bundle of sticks, and said:</p>
            <p class="pig-quote"> &quotPlease, man, give me those sticks to build me a house.&quot </p>               
            <p class="story-text">Which the man did, and the pig built his house. 
                Agian the wolf came along, knocked at the door, and said:</p>
            <p class="wolf-quote">&quotLittle pig, little pig, let me come in.&quot</p>
            <p class="pig-quote">&quotNo, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.&quot</p>
            <p class="wolf-quote">&quotThen I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.&quot</p>
            <p class="story-text">So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the little pig.</p>

            <!-- Third pig's house-->
            <p class="story-text">The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and said:</p>
            <p class="pig-quote"> &quotPlease, man, give me those bricks to build a house with.&quot</p>               
            <p class="story-text">So the man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them. 
                So the wolf came, as he did to the other little pigs, and said:</p>
            <p class="wolf-quote">“Little pig, little pig, let me come in.”</p>
            <p class="pig-quote">“No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.”</p>
            <p class="wolf-quote">“Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.”</p>
            <p class="story-text">Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, 
                and he puffed and huffed; but he could not get the house down. 
                When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said:</p>
            
            <!-- Getting Turnips -->
            <p class="wolf-quote">“Little pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips.”</p>
            <p class="pig-quote">“Where?”</p>
            <p class="wolf-quote">“Oh, in Mr Smith’s Home-field, and if you will be ready 
                tomorrow morning I will call for you, and we will go together, and get some for dinner.”</p>
            <p class="pig-quote">“Very well, I will be ready. What time do you mean to go?”</p>
            <p class="wolf-quote">“Oh, at six o’clock.”</p>
            <p class="story-text">Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the turnips before the wolf came 
                (which he did at about six).</p>
            <p class="wolf-quote">“Little Pig, are you ready?”</p>
            <p class="pig-quote">“Ready! I have been and come back again, and got a nice potful for dinner.”</p>
            <p class="story-text">The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to the 
                little pig somehow or other</p>

            <!-- Getting Apples -->
            <p class="wolf-quote">“Little pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree.”</p>
            <p class="pig-quote">“Where?”</p>
            <p class="wolf-quote">“Down at Merry-garden, and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, 
                at five o’clock tomorrow and get some apples.”</p>
            <p class="story-text">Well, the little pig bustled up the next morning at four o’clock, and 
                went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but he had further to go, 
                and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming, 
                which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much.</p>
            <p class="wolf-quote">“Little pig, what! Are you here before me? Are they nice apples?”</p>
            <p class="pig-quote">“Yes, very! I will throw you down one.”</p>
            <p class="story-text">And he threw it so far, that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, 
                the little pig jumped down and ran home.</p>

            <!-- Going to fair -->
            <p class="story-text">The next day the wolf came agian.</p>
            <p class="wolf-quote">“Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon, will you go?”</p>
            <p class="pig-quote">“Oh yes, I will go! What time shall you be ready?”</p>
            <p class="wolf-quote">“At three"</p>
            <p class="story-text">So the little pig went off before the time as usual, and got to the fair, 
                and bought a butter-churn, which he was going home with, when he saw the wolf coming. 
                Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and by so doing 
                turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf 
                so much, that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig’s house, and 
                told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.</p>
            <p class="pig-quote">“Hah, I frightened you, then. I had been to the fair and bought a butter-churn,
                 and when I saw you, I got into it, and rolled down the hill.”</p>
            <p class="story-text">Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he would eat up the little pig, 
                and that he would get down the chimney after him. When the little pig saw what he was about, he 
                hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as 
                the wolf was coming down, took off the cover, and in fell the wolf; so the little pig put on the 
                cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper, and lived happy ever afterwards.</p>
